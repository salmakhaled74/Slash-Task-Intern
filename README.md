# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Online Shopping Website

This project is an online shopping website built with React and Vite. It allows users to explore and filter products and view product details.

## Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salmakhaled74/Slash-Task-Intern.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   

   ```bash
   cd cd Slash-Task-Intern


4. Install dependencies:


   ```bash
   npm install
   
5. Start the development server:

### Project Structure
src/components: Contains React components used in the project.  
src/styles: Includes CSS styles for the components.  
src/contexts: Manages global state using React context.  
src/pages: Includes pages of the website.  

#### Design Decisions:

React and Vite: Chose React for building the user interface and Vite for its fast development server and optimized build process.  
Global State Management: Utilized React context for managing global state, making it accessible to various components. 
Component Structure: Organized components into a modular structure for better maintainability and reusability.  
Responsive Design: Ensured a responsive design to provide a seamless experience across different devices.  



##### Implementation Strategies:

Data Fetching: Used the fetch API to retrieve product data from a backend server.  
Filtering: Implemented filtering functionality based on price and rating, allowing users to refine product listings.
